# Example code for a Spring secured Vaadin web application
This project is based on the the Vaadin Spring starter (https://vaadin.com/start).

Import the project to the IDE of your choosing as a Maven project.

Run application using mvn spring-boot:run or directly running Application class from your IDE.

Open http://localhost:8080/ in browser

The `master` branch contains the general Spring Security configuration and for each specialized implementation we have created a dedicated branch. All examples use Vaadin 14.
